By first invoking "/challenge/run" provides with the location of the directory i.e., /proc/301. By changing directory to /proc/301 and then invoking /chall>command- cd /proc/301

##Position yet elsewhere
This challenge is similar to the previous challenge. The only difference is that the directory path is longer than the previous one.
command- cd /usr/share/zoneinfo/posix/Asia
         /challenge/run
flag- pwn.college{EDQsfhC72tuADNLNLHIF25BYdpN.dhDN1QDLxEjN0czW}

##Implicit relative paths, from /
The challenge wants us to invoke using / command, so "cd /" will open the home directory and the invoking "challenge/run" would give us the flag.
command- cd /
          challenge/run
flag- pwn.college{wEAuitzrmW-dvqtahTqWHADNxGE.dlDN1QDLxEjN0czW}

##Explicit relative paths, from /
This challenge is similar to the previous one. A relative path must used with /. While invoking "/challenge/run", start the command with "." to remain in t>command- cd /
         ./challenge/run
flag- pwn.college{wlQyOZk4qJNio3OUr7RsEA50ZUO.dBTN1QDLxEjN0czW}

##Implicit relative path
The program must be invoked from the challenge directory rather than the home directory like in the previous challenge. After changing directory, just usin>command- cd /challenge
         ./run

##Home sweet home
In this challenge we will first create a file having a single character("s") as its name with the "touch" c
